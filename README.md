## Final Project

Our group implement a game for kids to learn Cartesian coordinates.

Before starting the game, the system will generate fish head coordinates based on a uniform discrete distribution, and the direction of the fish will follow the white effort distribution.

### Default Value

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Fish length
        </th>
        <th>
            Fish amount
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            5
        </td>
        <td>
            1
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            4
        </td>
        <td>
            1
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            3
        </td>
        <td>
            2
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            2
        </td>
        <td>
            1
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Gameplay rule

Players can input coordinates to guess the actual location of the fish, and the system will use that location to mark the fish. If the capture is successful (player input coordinates overlap with the fish location), the location of the fish will be displayed.

The game will continue until all five fish generated by the system have been caught, at which point the system will generate the text (Congratulations !) and end the game. and end the game.
